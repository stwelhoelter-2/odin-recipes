    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Mmmm... look at that water. You know those geebs were milky. I know the water doesn't get changed often, but it's such as waste to just dump it after absorbing all that flavor. Instead, try a GB Water Tonic to feel your best when hydrating!</p>

        <li>1 pint of GB water (minimum 50 geebs taken from it)</li>
        <li>1 lime</li>
        <li>1 bottle Canada Dry</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Mix GB water and Canada Dry together.</li>
        <li>Cut limes and squeeze into mix.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
